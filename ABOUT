Hi! Thanks for taking the time to read this. I'll keep it short.

This was written by Justin McKinstry (justin.mckinstry@gmail.com) (9ABC91ED61DE9BE0) as a replacement for the short-lived Listening Room website (which is not mine and I did not have any hand in making it).

The premise is that normal people connect to a page, choose some songs to share with people they know, and then those songs play for everybody. It's not meant for sharing music files, just the experience. All the rest is minor details.

Since the previous incarnation folded due to bandwidth concerns, I figured I'd try my hand at something a little more... dynamic.

I hope you enjoy!
