# listening_room
A replacement for the now-defunct Listening Room. Share songs privately with your friends without the need to upload them anywhere.

# About
Long ago, friends that I worked with would share our music via a page calling itself Listening Room. We'd each queue up some of our songs and they'd play round-robin until we were done. It was a great way to share genres and interests without having to muck about with files.

That site is long since gone (so much so that I am having difficulty finding it to cite its original owner by name), but the desire for sharing music over the network instead of out loud where it can disturb folks working is the same. So this is my attempt at bringing the idea back.

As the original source explained before going dark, server-client streaming of high-quality audio is bandwidth-intensive. This project aims to alleviate that by using the wonderful [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/) library, so listeners share the burden.
